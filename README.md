I'm Daniel Yang, or what I would prefer to go by in the sea of Daniel Yangs, **Woo**.

I am a **pure mathematics** and **combinatorics/optimization** student at the **University of Waterloo**. I want to learn as much as I can to truly understand the mathematics behind computer science.

Currently, I am working on:
- *Microsoft Azure AI Certificate* through *WeAccelerate*
- [University of Waterloo Mathematics undergraduate calendar](https://github.com/sprwoo/UW-Undergrad-Calendar)
- Building my own [interpreter](https://github.com/sprwoo/Compiler) from scratch
- Building a neural network from scratch

When I am not doing any of these things, I am either stressing over math, grinding [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/sprucetreeleaf/), looping killers in Dead by Daylight, or dreading over my unemployment. 

Feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangiel/) if you need to for some reason.
